"One Man Party"
----------
Project Description:  
"One Man Party" is the game I personally developed during my second semester at "Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences" as part of the "Animation & Game" study course.
Because of Corona we didn't have the possibility to work in teams. Thus everything in the project all assets including (code, sprites, tilemaps etc.) except the soundtrack and all design decisions (character design, game design, level design etc.) were made by me in the span of 3 months during my studies.

In the asset folder you will find code and assets created by me for this game. To get a feel for how the game looks please refer to the links below.
