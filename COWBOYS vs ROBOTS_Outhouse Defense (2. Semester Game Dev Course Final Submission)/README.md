"Cowboys vs Robots"
----------
Project Description:  
"Cowboys vs Robots" is the final submission of my second semester game dev course. It is a game accumulating all the learned techniques over the semester developed in the span of two weeks with the help of various asset packs from the unity asset store. 
This includes, but is not limited to pathfinding, FSM, observer pattern, gameplay architecture/ logic using scriptable objects, object pooling, networking using PUN, serialization, adding "juice", utilizing the cinemachine and timelines and achieving visual quality using post processing and shaders.

The code folder only conatains the code created by myself, so it is not all of the games logic. To get a feel for the full game please refer to the link below.
