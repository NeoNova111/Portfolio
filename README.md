# Portfolio
----------
Hey!   
My name is Carlo,  
and welcome to my game development/ programming portfolio!
I am an aspiring game developer/ programmer with a bachelor's degree in "Animation & Game" at "Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences" in Dieburg.
  
This repository shows off a wide variety of projects I worked on in small teams during my studies. I mainly focused on programming, but also regularly contributed as a game designer. These projects should give you a good overview of my skills and progress as a game developer/ programmer.

I also worked on <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/">Studio Fizbin's "Project: Kokidon"</a> as a programmer for 6 months, during an internship. As of October 2023, the game has not been fully announced/ released yet so I can not talk about my specific contributions at this point.

Please consider my priority list if you are short on time and can only look at a few of my projects. Or just refer to the showreels linked at the top of the project pages, to get a quick overview of my most relevant contributions for said project (they are all bite-sized with a length of 1 minute and 30 seconds each).

Of course, I still encourage you to take a look at all of them ;)
