# Portfolio
----------
Hey!
I'm Carlo, a passionate game developer and programmer, and I welcome you to my game development/ programming portfolio. I have a bachelor's degree in 'Animation & Game' from 'Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences in Dieburg. My primary expertise is in working with Unity & C#, but I also have a fundamental understanding of other languages, such as Java, SQL, C++, and Lua.
  
During my studies, I worked on various smaller games in teams of various sizes, ranging from 4 - 15 developers. This repository shows the wide range of games of various genres and styles I worked on during my studies. I mainly focused on programming but also regularly contributed as a game designer.

Although some of these projects no longer represent my current skill level, they provide valuable insight into my journey and evolution as a game developer/programmer. I especially learned a lot and made huge improvements when working with industry professionals on <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/">Studio Fizbin's "Project: Kokidon"</a> as a programmer for 6 months, during an internship. While I can't go into specific details of my contribution to the project due to project confidentiality, I can offer a general overview of my experiences and contributions <a href="https://github.com/NeoNova111/Portfolio/tree/main/Project%20Kokidon">here</a>.

If you are short on time consider checking out the bite-sized (1m 30s) showreels linked at the top of my semester project pages.

Of course, I still encourage you to take a look at the whole portfolio to get to know me best ;)
