Welcome to my game development/ programming portfolio!
My name is Carlo and I am an aspiring game developer currently studying "Animation & Game" at "Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences" in Dieburg.
I am currently (1/12/2021) in my 3. semester. This repository shows off the projects I worked on during my studies and thus shows my skill level for the respective semesters.
