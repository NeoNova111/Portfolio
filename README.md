# Portfolio
----------
Hey, my name is Carlo,  
and welcome to my game development/ programming portfolio!
I am an aspiring game developer currently studying "Animation & Game" at "Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences" in Dieburg.
As of the 2nd of March 2022 I just finished my 5. semester of studying.  
  
This repository shows off the projects I worked on as a game designer and programmer during my studies. They should give you a good overview over my skills and progress as a game developer/ programmer.
----------
Priority:  
1. 5th Semester Project "Abandoned_64"  
2. 3rd Semester Project "Megalophobia"  
3. Free Elective Project "Checkout"  
4. 2nd Semester Project "One Man Party"  

If you only have time to take a look at one/ or a few of these projects I recommend you to consider my priority list. Of course I still encourage you to take a look at all of them ;)
