# Portfolio
----------
Hey, my name is Carlo,  
and welcome to my game development/ programming portfolio!
I am an aspiring game developer currently studying "Animation & Game" at "Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences" in Dieburg.
As of the 21st of July 2022 I just finished my 6. semester of studying.  
  
This repository shows off the projects I worked on mainly a as the programmer, but also as a game designer during my studies. They should give you a good overview over my skills and progress as a game developer/ programmer.

If you are short on time and can only look at a few of my projects, please consider my priority list. Or just refer to the showreel linked at the bottom of each of the projects pages, to get a quick overview over my most relevant contributions for said project (they are all bite sized with a length of 1 minute and 30 seconds each).

Of course I still encourage you to take a look at all of them ;)
