Project Description:  
"Megalophobia" narrative driven singleplayer experience in which you take control of the two man submarine Кефаль (Kefal) on their search mission for a missing submarine in the depths of the ocean. In this project I was responsible for all the gameplay logic and all other coded systems, some game design aspects and some of the shaders (e.g. the scanner).
It is the first full game project I have worked on in a collaborative team effort during my studies.

The assets folder only contains the assets (for this project the code) created by myself.
